Bayesian Inference in Practice


* Are frequentist methods incorrect then?

 No.
 Frequentist methods are still useful or state-of-the-art in many areas. Tools such as least squares linear regression, LASSO regression, and expectation-maximization algorithms are all powerful and fast. Bayesian methods complement these techniques by solving problems that these approaches cannot.


 The much more difficult analytic problems involve "medium data" and /really small/ data.

   dist = stats.beta
   n_trials = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 50, 500]
   data = stats.bernoulli.rvs(0.5, size=n_trials[-1])
   x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)

   for k, N in enumerate(n_trials):
       heads = data[:N].sum()
       y = dist.pdf(x, 1 + heads, 1 + N - heads)
       print(heads, y)
