How to solve 90% of NLP problems: a step-by-step guide


Notes about the [[https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e?imm_mid=0fb117][Using Machine Learning to understand and leverage text]]

* Intro

The science of extracting meaning and learning from text data is an active topic
of research called Natural Language Processing (NLP)


 The Insight team has seen a few key practical applications come up much more
 frequently than any other:
     - Identifying different cohorts of users/customers (prediction churn,
       lifetime value, product preferences)
     - Accurately detecting and extracting different categories of feedback
       (positive and negative reviews/opinios)
     - Classifying text according to intent (request for basic help, urgent problem)

 
* How this article can help

 We will begin with *the simplest method* that could work, and then move on to
 more nuanced solutions, such as featuring engineering, word vectors, and deep
 learning.



* Step 1: Gather your data

 Common sources of textual information include:
     - Product reviews
     - User-generated content (Tweets, Facebook, questions...)
     - Troubleshooting


 Example that will be used for this tutorial... *Disaster on Social Media*
 dataset. Our task will be to detect which tweets are about disastrous event as
 opposed to an irrelevant topic.

"Rather than spending a month figuring out an unsupervised machine learning
problem, just label some data for a week and train a classifier"
</LOL>


* Step 2: Clean your data

"A clean dataset will allow a model to learn meaningful features and not overfit
on irrelevant noise."

1. Remove all irrelevant characters such as any non alphanumeric characters
2. Tokenize your test by separating it into individual words
3. Remove words that are not relevant, such as "@" twitter mentions or urls
4. Convert all characters to lowercase, in order to treat words with different
   capitalization the same way
5. Consider combining misspelled or alternately spelled words to a single
   representation (e.g. "cool"/"kool"/"cooool")
6. Consider lemmatization (reduce words such as "am", "are", and "is")
