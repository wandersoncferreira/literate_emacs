Boost performance by leveraging byte-compilation


Emacs's Lisp interpreter is able to interpret two kinds of code: humanly readable code and machine optimized code.

Byte-compiled code runs faster than humanly readable code.

One can also byte-compile Emacs Lisp source files using Emacs in batch mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  emacs -batch -f batch-byte-compile ~/.emacs.d/**/*.el
#+END_SRC

Of course we can easily create an Emacs command that does the same thing:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun bk/byte-compile-init-dir ()
    "Byte-compile all your dotfiles."
    (interactive)
    (byte-recompile-directory user-emacs-directory 0))
#+END_SRC
